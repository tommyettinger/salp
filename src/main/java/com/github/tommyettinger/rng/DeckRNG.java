/**
 * An RNG variant that has 16 possible grades of value it can produce and shuffles them like a deck of cards.
 * It repeats grades of value, but not exact values, every 16 numbers requested from it. Grades go in increments of
 * 0.0625 from 0.0 to 0.9375, and are added to a random double less than 0.0625 to get the random number for that
 * grade.
 * <p>
 * You can get values from this generator with: {@link #nextDouble()}, {@link #nextInt()},
 * {@link #nextLong()}, and the bounded variants on each of those.
